# Project Requirements
 - Set up with Webpack, Express, Node, and Sass, and Service Workers
    - Webpack, Express, Node.js, Sass, and Service Workers should be properly configured and integrated into the project.
 
 -  Have separate dev and prod configurations for Webpack
    - Webpack configurations should be separated into development and production environments to ensure optimized builds for each scenario.

 - Have the developer environment set up with the Webpack dev server
    - The development environment should utilize the Webpack dev server for live reloading and efficient development workflows.

 - Have a minimum of one form field
    - The application should include at least one form field for user input, such as the URL input field for submitting articles or blogs.
 
 - Make one request to the meaningcloud API
   - The application should make at least one request to the MeaningCloud API to perform sentiment analysis on the submitted content.
 
 - Use Sass for styling
   - Sass should be used as the preprocessor for styling the application, allowing for modular and maintainable CSS code.
 
 - Minify js and styles in the production environment
    - JavaScript and CSS files should be minified in the production environment to reduce file sizes and improve loading times.
 
 - Response from the API must be added to the view for a user to see
    - The sentiment analysis response from the MeaningCloud API should be integrated into the application's view, allowing users to see the analysis results.
 
 - Be able to show content offline
   - The application should utilize Service Workers to enable offline functionality, allowing users to access previously visited content even without an internet connection.

   
All of these requirements are explained throughout the course. Specifics on setting up the MeaningCloud API are found in the README file of this repository.
